This Python project focuses on predicting Hepatitis C based on a dataset using various data science and machine learning concepts. Let's break down the key elements and concepts used:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The project starts with importing the necessary libraries and the dataset. The dataset is then examined for missing values and cleaned using techniques like replacing missing values with zeros and dropping rows with null values. Data types are adjusted for analysis.

Statistical Analysis and Visualization: Statistical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance are calculated for features such as age, cholinesterase (CHE), and cholesterol (CHOL). Visualizations including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are created to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

Machine Learning: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes are applied to predict the Hepatitis C category based on features like sex, albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin (BIL), cholinesterase (CHE), cholesterol (CHOL), creatinine (CREA), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and proteins (PROT).

Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the machine learning models is evaluated using metrics like accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix to assess their performance in predicting Hepatitis C categories.

Linear Regression: Linear regression is used to understand the relationship between predictor variables (features) and the target variable (Category). The coefficients of the linear regression model are calculated to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable.

Clustering: K-Means clustering is applied to the scaled dataset to cluster the data into different groups based on their similarity. The number of clusters is determined using the elbow method.

Conclusion: The project concludes with the completion of data cleaning, statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and clustering. It demonstrates the application of various data science and machine learning concepts in predicting Hepatitis C based on the provided dataset.
